    "\n",
    "Hurricanes often count among the worst natural disasters, both in terms of monetary costs, and more importantly, human life. Data Science can help us better understand these storms. For example, take a quick look at this FiveThirtyEight analysis by Maggie Koerth-Baker: [Why We're Stuck With An Inadequate Hurricane Rating System](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-were-stuck-with-an-inadequate-hurricane-rating-system/)\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, you'll be analyzing data in the `hurricanes.csv` file. We generated this data file by writing a Python program to extract data from several lists of hurricanes over the Atlantic Ocean on Wikipedia (here is an [example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Atlantic_hurricane_season)). You can take a look at the script `gen_csv.ipynb` yourself. At the end of the semester, you will be able to write it yourself. \n",
    "\n",
    "Start by downloading `project.py`, `p5_test.py`, and `hurricanes.csv` if you haven't already downloaded them. Double check that these files don't get renamed by your browser (by running `ls` in the terminal from your `p5` project directory). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We won't explain how to use the `project` module here (the code in the `project.py` file). Refer to [lab-p5](https://git.doit.wisc.edu/cdis/cs/courses/cs220/cs220-s23-projects/-/tree/main/lab-p5) to understand how the module works. If necessary, use the `help` function to learn about the various functions inside `project.py`. Feel free to take a look at the `project.py` code, if you are curious about how it works.\n",

    "\n",
    "You **may not** hardcode indices in your code unless specified in the question. If you hardcode the value of `project.count()`, we'll **manually deduct** points from your autograder score on Gradescope during code review. If you are not sure what hardcoding is, here is a simple test you can use to determine whether you have hardcoded:\n",
    "\n",
    "*If we were to change the data (e.g. add more hurricanes, or switch the columns or rows) would your code still find the correct answer to the question as it is asked?*\n",
    "\n",
    "If your answer to that question is *No*, then you have likely hardcoded something. Please reach out to TAs/PMs during office hours to find out how you can **avoid hardcoding**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Store** your final answer for each question in the **variable specified for each question**. This step is important because Otter grades your work by comparing the value of this variable against the correct answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "For some of the questions, we'll ask you to write (then use) a function to compute the answer.  If you compute the answer **without** creating the function we ask you to write, we'll **manually deduct** points from your autograder score on Gradescope, even if the way you did it produced the correct answer. \n",
    "\n",
    "Required Functions:\n",
    "- `get_month`\n",
    "- `get_day`\n",
    "- `get_year`\n",
    "- `format_damage`\n",
    "- `deadliest_in_range`\n",
    "- `get_year_total`\n",
    "    \n",
    "Students are only allowed to use Python commands and concepts that have been taught in the course prior to the release of p5. Therefore, **you should not use concepts/modules such as lists, dictionaries, or the pandas module, to name a few examples**.  We will **manually deduct** points from your autograder score on Gradescope otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more details on what will cause you to lose points during code review and specific requirements, please take a look at the [Grading rubric](https://git.doit.wisc.edu/cdis/cs/courses/cs220/cs220-s23-projects/-/blob/main/p5/rubric.md)."

    "## Incremental Coding and Testing:\n",
    "\n",
    "You should always strive to do incremental coding. Incremental coding enables you to avoid challenging bugs. Always write a few lines of code and then test those lines of code, before proceeding to write further code. You can call the `print` function to test intermediate step outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also recommend you do incremental testing: make sure to run the local tests as soon as you are done with a question. This will ensure that you haven't made a big mistake that might potentially impact the rest of your project solution. Please refrain from making multiple submissions on Gradescope for testing individual questions' answers. Instead use the local tests, to test your solution on your laptop.\n",

    "Also, remember to check with the [p5 rubric](https://git.doit.wisc.edu/cdis/cs/courses/cs220/cs220-s23-projects/-/blob/main/p5/rubric.md) to verify that you will not be losing any points during manual review."

    "### Function 1: `format_damage(damage)`\n",
    "\n",
    "You will notice if you look at the dataset that the damages caused by the hurricanes are not stored directly as numbers. Instead the damages have a suffix (`\"K\"`, `\"M\"`, or `\"B\"`) attached at the very end. You will have to convert these 'numbers' into integers before you can perform any mathematical operations on them. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since you will need to format damages for multiple hurricanes, you **must** create a general helper function that handles the `\"K\"`, `\"M\"`, and `\"B\"` suffixes. Remember that `\"K\"` stands for thousand, `\"M\"` stands for million, and `\"B\"` stands for billion. For example, your function should convert the string `\"13.5M\"` to `13500000`, `\"6.9K\"` to `6900` and so on. Note that for **some** hurricanes, the `damage` does **not** have **any** suffixes. For instance, the hurricane `Florence` at index `308` did damage `'0'`. Your function **must** also deal with such inputs, by directly typecasting them to ints. \n",
    "\n",
    "This function should take in the strings from the `damage` column as input, and return an **int**. Refer to Task 3.2 in [lab-p5](https://git.doit.wisc.edu/cdis/cs/courses/cs220/cs220-s23-projects/-/tree/main/lab-p5) to understand how to slice and calculate damage.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Warning:** Your function `format_damage` must take in the damage as a **string**, and **not** an index. If you code your function to take in the index of a hurricane, and return the damage caused as an int, it will be useful only for this project. To make your function more useful, you must make it accept the damage itself (i.e., a string like `\"13.5M\"` or `\"6.9K\"`) as input."
